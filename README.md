## Motivation

The motivation behind this project was a personal curiosity to understand my music taste and how it evolves with the seasons. I aimed to gain insights into the patterns and variations in my listening habits.

## Data Source

The data for this analysis comes from Spotify, providing a detailed streaming history. I collected this data to explore the dynamics of my music preferences over time.

## Overview

This project explores the seasonal patterns in my Spotify listening history. The analysis includes insights into daily song counts, most-listened genres per season, and top 10 artists for each season. The project also features an interactive website that visually presents the findings with interactive charts and a unique music playback experience.

   - Seasonal patterns, daily counts, and top genres and artists were extracted from the data.
   - The analysis involved the following stages and techniques:
     - **Data Collection:**
       - I started by requesting my streaming history from Spotify, which was downloaded in JSON format.
       - An online tool was used to extract genre information for each song.
     - **Data Preprocessing:**
       - The collected data was cleaned and processed using Pandas in Python.
       - Date and time information was converted, and new columns such as season, day, and duration were created.
     - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
       - Various EDA techniques were applied to understand the distribution of song counts, artist preferences, and genres.
       - Seasonal patterns and daily listening habits were explored.
     - **Visualization:**
       - Matplotlib and Seaborn were utilized to create visualizations, including line charts, bar charts, and interactive elements.

2. **Interactive Website:**
   - The project includes an interactive NextJS 14 website showcasing the analysis results.
   - Notable features include:
     - **Daily Song Counts Line Chart:** Interactive chart displaying the daily song counts with mouse-over information.
